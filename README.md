This repo is one where i stash all of my useful bash script for making
my linux usage and journey easy. I am no pro but i am certain any one looking
in this repo will certainly find something that tends to be pretty **useful.**

## Run the bunnys
To run any of the **bunnys** follow the steps bellow.
1. clone the repo.
	`git clone <this_url> # literally this url`
	clone the repo and **cd** into it. Hopefully you already know how to change
	your directory in linux.
1. Give the executing right / access to the **bunny** you wanna run.
	`chmod +755 ./<script_name>.sh`
	replace the **<script_name>** with the name of the script you wanna run.
1. Simply run them now.
	`bash ./<script_name>.sh`
	i prefixed the command with **bash** because i do no know what shell environment you are using.
